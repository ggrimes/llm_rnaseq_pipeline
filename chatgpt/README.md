Here's a basic Nextflow RNA-Seq pipeline using Salmon for quantifying gene expression from raw sequencing reads. You can customize this pipeline according to your needs. This pipeline assumes that you have already built an index for your reference transcriptome using Salmon.

First, create a file named nextflow.config to define the pipeline parameters:


Next, create the main pipeline file named main.nf:


This pipeline assumes you have a script named tximport.R that takes a list of Salmon quantification outputs and generates a combined gene expression matrix. You can create this script using the tximport package in R:

To run the pipeline, make sure the main.nf, nextflow.config, and tximport.R files are in the same directory, and then execute the following command:

```
nextflow run main.nf
```

This pipeline will perform quantification using Salmon and generate an expression matrix from the resulting quantification files.
